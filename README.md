# UPWARD Examples

Simple examples using [UPWARD JS](https://github.com/magento-research/pwa-studio/tree/develop/packages/upward-js) as a server, to run them:

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. Open the `server.js` file and change the `upwardPath` to point to the YML config you want to test.
3. Run `yarn start` to start the node server or `yarn start:express` to run a standard express server with UPWARD as a middleware.

Enjoy!
